A good way to secure system is to lock it. Lock it form any unwanted connections and requests. With the age of more and more distributed APIs how do you connect and talk with your providers API and services though?

For example, when you're building secure infrastructure in Google Cloud, you often face a dilemma: how do you keep your VMs locked down (no external IPs) while still allowing them to access Google APIs and services? 𝗘𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝗣𝗿𝗶𝘃𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗚𝗼𝗼𝗴𝗹𝗲 𝗔𝗰𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀! 🚀

𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗶𝘀 𝗣𝗿𝗶𝘃𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗚𝗼𝗼𝗴𝗹𝗲 𝗔𝗰𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀?
Private Google Access enables VM instances that only have internal IP addresses to reach Google APIs and services. Your instances can communicate with:

→ Google Cloud Storage
→  BigQuery
→ Cloud SQL
→ Network Management API (networkmanagement.googleapis.com) for connectivity diagnostics + many more


Key Benefits:
🔐 Enhanced Security: No external IP addresses = reduced attack surface
💰 Cost Optimization: No charges for external IP addresses
🌐 Simplified Network Architecture: Keep everything internal while maintaining connectivity
⚡ Performance: Traffic stays within Google's network infrastructure

Real-World Example:
Imagine you have VMs behind strict firewalls that need to use the Network Management API (networkmanagement.googleapis.com) to check network connectivity during diagnosis. With Private Google Access:

✅ Your VMs access Google APIs using internal IPs only
✅ Traffic never leaves Google's secure network
✅ Zero configuration changes needed on your applications
✅ Full API functionality maintained for your health checkup

Sounds exciting? Features like these help you to lock down your infrastructure while keeping essential API connectivity intact! 🔒
